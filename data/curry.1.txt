NAME
----
curry - The command-line currency converter

SYNOPSIS
--------
*curry* ['options'] 'from' 'to' ['amount' ['amount...']]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*Curry* is a command-line currency converter, with suport for getting exchange
rates from multiple API providers, including:

- rate-exchange.appspot.com
- oanda.com
- finance.yahoo.com
- openexchangerates.org
- exchangerate-api.com

The positional arguments 'from' and 'to' are required, and defines the
transaction currency and the payment currency respectively. Additionaly you can
provide one or more 'amount' arguments, which will be summed together.

*-h, --help*::
	Show a help message and then exit.

*--version*::
	Show the version number and then exit.

*-l, --list*::
	Show a list of available API providers and then exit.

*-a, --api* 'API'::
	Get exchange rates from a spesific API provider. Use *--list* to see a
	list of available API providers.

*-k, --key* 'KEY'::
	Provide an API-key to use with API providers that requires one. It's a good
	idea to combine this with the *--save* flag. This ensures that the API-key
	is saved in the config file.

	Save current command-line options to the config file.

*-r, --refresh-cache*::

*-v, --verbose*::
	Increase logging verbosity. For each *-v* flag, more messages are logged to
	the console. Use *-v* to enable 'info' messages, and *-vv* to enable 'debug'
	messages. Without the flag, only 'errors' and 'warnings' are shown.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
The main configuration file is *~/.config/curry/config.ini*. The default
settings look like this:

	[curry]
	api = finance.yahoo.com
	cache_timeout = 43200

where 'api' points to the API provider to use, if no *--api* flag is provided,
and 'cache_timeout' defines how long a cache should be kept before requesting
new data from the API provider. This value should be in seconds, e.g. 12 hours
= 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 12 hours = 43200 seconds.

	Cache directory.

*~/.config/curry/*::
	Configuration directory.

*~/.config/curry/config.ini*::
	Main configuration file.
